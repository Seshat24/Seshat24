- 👋 Hi, I’m an oddball outcast who has never really found thier place in this world until I discovered coding.@Seshat24
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, account recovery, and above all else alternative solutions to the tech giants and their strangle hold on society.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything I can about coding, software development, and spreading the knowledge of minimizing our online foot prints while still contributing to the greater good.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing and distrubiting FOSS to the world at large and minmizing our dependance on clearnet out for profit companiens that routinely violate our privacy and our freedom.
- 📫 How to reach me, email anytime or check for my tag in tech forums, discipulus-vitae@outlook.com or Seshat24 in the forums.
- 😄 Pronouns: Depending on who's in the driver seat all are applicable. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite book series is The Sword of Truth by Terry Goodkind. Wizards First Rule is both factual and applicable.
